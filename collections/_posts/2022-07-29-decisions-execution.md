Quality of life is the result of a series of decisions.  Avoid as many wrong decisions as possible.

The three most critical decisions are:

1. Where you live (network, opportunities)
2. What you do (job or career)
3. Who you’re with (relationship)

You start your 20s with no answers.  Lacking experience, you make wrong decisions.

Wrong decisions will happen.  Recognize and reverse them immediately.  Every wrong decision is your teacher.

Right decisions, executed poorly, will also cause failure.  This is your opportunity to reinvent yourself.

Right decisions and right execution: winner!

Consider first what would be a right answer to the three big questions (where you live, what you do, who you're with).  Next, work on execution, being mindful of strengths and weaknesses.  After gaining new perspective, refine the decisions and their execution.
