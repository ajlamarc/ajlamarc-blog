We all make stupid decisions every day.  The resulting failures cause regret and lead to indecision (the path of least resistance).  In the end everyone loses and doesn't know why.

Well, _almost_ everyone makes stupid decisions.  In the "not an idiot" camp are [Warren Buffett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett) and [Charlie Munger](https://fs.blog/intellectual-giants/charlie-munger/) of Berkshire Hathaway.

Luckily for us, Charlie Munger has spared some time to teach us all how to be a bit less stupid.  Munger teaches the importance of [mental models](https://fs.blog/mental-models/) and multidisciplinary thinking, but leaves his own application of these techniques vague.
Munger's teaching style invites us on a journey of self-discovery, as we acquire models and integrate them into our decision-making framework.  [Or it just primes us to buy a course](https://fs.blog/mental-models-for-better-thinking-course/).

## munger's students
Charlie Munger is the Bible for decision makers.  Most people don't have the patience or intellect to understand the Bible, so we need someone to [break it down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-wWBGo6a2w&list=PL22J3VaeABQD_IZs7y60I3lUrrFTzkpat&ab_channel=JordanBPeterson) for us.  And someone to [break down the breakdown](https://medium.com/be-a-brilliant-writer/this-forgotten-book-could-change-your-life-jordan-petersons-biblical-lectures-f01ae8ea4bf0).  

Likewise for "Mungerisms."  Directly downstream of Munger are Peter Kaufman and Peter Bevelin, who wrote [the](https://www.poorcharliesalmanack.com/pca.php) [definitive](https://www.poorcharliesalmanack.com/seeking_wisdom.php) [books](https://www.poorcharliesalmanack.com/all_i_want_to_know.php) on Munger's wisdom and mental models.  Go down another level and find [the](https://fs.blog/) [bloggers](https://www.wealest.com/) referencing those ideas and adding their own personal flair.

As a third-rate blogger, I will now reference those ideas and add personal flair.

Peter Kaufman is the compiler of [Poor Charlie's Almanack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poor_Charlie%27s_Almanack) and giver of [this talk](https://soundcloud.com/user-339685480/peter-kaufman-on-the-multi-disciplinary-approach-to-thinking), 
which I will refer to as "The Greatest Talk Of All Time" (TGTOAT).  I just realized that TGTOAT is, in fact, TGTOAT, but I've been beaten to [the](https://fs.blog/great-talks/multidisciplinary-approach-thinking-peter-kaufman/) [punch](https://www.wealest.com/articles/slow-incremental-progress) on breaking it down.

### introducing TGTOAT
From science and statistics, we know that the largest possible sample size yields the most accurate conclusion.  Even better if seemingly unrelated samples point the same direction.
Kaufman identifies the three largest samples to pull from: the inorganic universe (13.7 billion years), biology on Earth (3.5 billion years), and recorded human history (20,000 years).
From those samples, he derives the world's two most important ideas: _mirrored reciprocation_ and _compound interest_.
Applying mirrored reciprocation means "go positive and go first", and applying compound interest means "be constant."

Combining the two yields the singular most important idea:
<blockquote>
    A great “Life Hack” is to simply combine these two into one basic approach to living your life: “Go positive and go first, and be constant in doing it.”  There may be no better formula for living the best life you could possibly live. -Farnam Street

The future posts of this series will be applications of our new "Life Hack."  And if you haven't already, don't miss out on hearing [TGTOAT](https://soundcloud.com/user-339685480/peter-kaufman-on-the-multi-disciplinary-approach-to-thinking).

    The world is so damn simple. It’s not complicated at all! Every single person on this planet is looking for the same thing. Now, why is it that we don’t act on these very simple things? -Peter Kaufman
